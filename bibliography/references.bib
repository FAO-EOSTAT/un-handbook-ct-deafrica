    ABSTRACT = "Mapping smallholder irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa using remote sensing techniques is challenging due to its small and scattered areas and heterogenous cropping practices. A study was conducted to examine the impact of sample size and composition on the accuracy of classifying irrigated agriculture in Mozambique’s Manica and Gaza provinces using three algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Four scenarios were considered, and the results showed that smaller datasets can achieve high and sufficient accuracies, regardless of their composition. However, the user and producer accuracies of irrigated agriculture do increase when the algorithms are trained with larger datasets. The study also found that the composition of the training data is important, with too few or too many samples of the “irrigated agriculture” class decreasing overall accuracy. The algorithms’ robustness depends on the training data’s composition, with RF and SVM showing less decrease and spread in accuracies than ANN. The study concludes that the training data size and composition are more important for classification than the algorithms used. RF and SVM are more suitable for the task as they are more robust or less sensitive to outliers than the ANN. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into mapping smallholder irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa using remote sensing techniques.",

EOSTAT is deploying a set of novel approaches, data sources, and analytical tools to drive agricultural innovation. Currently, there are limited resources to collect, analyse and disseminate agricultural statistics on a regular basis. Earth Observation (EO) data is an ideal solution to fill this gap and strengthen the capacity to generate crop statistics at national and subnational levels. However, access, storage, pre-processing and analysis of EO data is limiting its use and uptake. Under the framework of the EOSTAT project, FAO has established a collaboration with Digital Earth Africa and FrontierSI to develop an open-source, user-friendly solution that will facilitate countries in Africa to map land cover and crop types. This project has developed a prototype land cover classification workflow within the Digital Earth Africa platform that is scalable to enable land use monitoring at a local and national scale. An initial land cover map for Rwanda has been produced and assessed through comparison against validation data and stakeholder engagement. This workflow along with future crop monitoring work conducted as part of this project will empower countries in Africa to implement a cost-effective land use and crop monitoring system (crop area and yield) using the Digital Earth Africa platform and satellite imagery.",

    abstract = "Land cover classification in remote sensing is often faced with the challenge of limited ground truth labels. Incorporating historical ground information has the potential to significantly lower the expensive cost associated with collecting ground truth and, more importantly, enable early- and in-season mapping that is helpful to many pre-harvest decisions. In this study, we propose a new approach that can effectively transfer knowledge about the topology (i.e. relative position) of different crop types in the spectral feature space (e.g. the histogram of SWIR1 vs RDEG1 bands) to generate labels, thereby supporting crop classification in a different year. Importantly, our approach does not attempt to transfer classification decision boundaries that are susceptible to inter-annual variations of weather and management, but relies on the more robust and shift-invariant topology information. We tested this approach for mapping corn/soybeans in the US Midwest, paddy rice/corn/soybeans in Northeast China and multiple crops in Northern France using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data. Results show that our approach automatically generates high-quality labels for crops in the target year immediately after each image becomes available. Based on these generated labels from our approach, the subsequent crop type mapping using a random forest classifier can reach the F1 score as high as 0.887 for corn as early as the silking stage and 0.851 for soybean as early as the flowering stage and the overall accuracy of 0.873 in the test state of Iowa. In Northeast China, F1 scores of paddy rice, corn and soybeans and the overall accuracy can exceed 0.85 two and half months ahead of harvest. In the Hauts-de-France region, the OA of multiple crop mapping could reach 0.837 based on labels generated from our approach. Overall, these results highlight the unique advantages of our approach in transferring historical knowledge and maximizing the timeliness of crop maps. Our approach supports a general paradigm shift towards learning transferrable and generalizable knowledge to facilitate land cover classification."
