    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Africa offers continental-scale satellite-derived data products and provides guidance on their application in analytical workflows. This chapter demonstrates the use of high quality, cloud-free, geomedian composite images with median absolute deviations (GeoMADs) for crop type mapping. Digital Earth Africa’s GeoMADs are applied to a classification framework in the satellite image time series (`sits`) package in the R language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter demonstrates how high-quality, ‘off-the-shelf’ satellite image composites can overcome common challenges in classification workflows, such as the ‘curse of dimensionality’ and computational demand. It also introduces readers and users to Digital Earth Africa products and services, and modes of access, especially through the `sits` R package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter covers the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Background to Digital Earth Africa data products and services.\n",
    "2.  The `sits` package and interaction with Digital Earth Africa.\n",
    "3.  Geomedian composite images and their application in classification workflows.\n",
    "4.  Sourcing, loading, and inspecting reference data for crop type mapping.\n",
    "5.  Loading Digital Earth Africa data with both `sits` and `rstac`.\n",
    "6.  Masking satellite data to cropland.\n",

    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Africa provides open access to over 80 spatial datasets covering the African continent. They cover thematics including land cover, coasts, agriculture, topography, water, and vegetation. These datasets can be explored in several platforms. The [Digital Earth Africa Explorer](https://explorer.digitalearth.africa/products) displays metadata for each dataset, including availability in space and time. It also enables download of single band .tif files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Africa data can be visualised in the Digital Earth Africa Maps platform. This platform also supports basic visual analysis including differencing and comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa Sandbox is a JupyterHub computing environment where users can interact with Digital Earth Africa data using Python. The Sandbox provides a direct connection to the Digital Earth Africa implementation of the Open Data Cube, so datasets can easily be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Africa data is also retrievable using the STAC library through packages such as `odc-stac` (Python) and `rstac` (R). Digital Earth Africa maintains a repository of odc-stac examples. This chapter uses the `sits` R package to access and analyse Digital Earth Africa data for the purposes of agricultural mapping and monitoring.\n",

    "## R sits and Digital Earth Africa\n",

However, the `sits` package builds upon the `rstac` package which integrates with Digital Earth Africa through Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalogs (STAC). Digital Earth Africa data can therefore be loaded into cubes and other forms amenable to analysis in R.\n",

    "## Digital Earth Africa Geomedians (GeoMADs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will focus on the application of cloud-free geometric median (geomedian) composite images as input data for agricultural mapping. Surface reflectance data collected at regular intervals are often used as input data in machine learning workflows for agricultural mapping such as cropland extent mapping and crop-type mapping. However, single observations can be affected by cloud or other interferences, and are subject to noise. Cloud-free geomedian composite images preserve the high-dimensional relationships between spectral bands and provide a single, high-quality observation for each band over a given period [[4](#ref-dale2017)]. This reduces the dimensionality of the data and therefore the computational burden of running classification algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Digital Earth Africa's geomedian products](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/GeoMAD_specs.html) include measures of temporal variation as median absolute deviations (MADs) [[5](#ref-dale2018)]. They are effectively a measure of temporal variation over the period covered by the geomedian. The MADs are therefore useful for change detection, or highlighting land classes undergoing frequent change, such as cropland subjected to patterns of cultivation, intense crop growth, and harvest. The combination of the geomedian and MADs is called the GeoMAD. MADs available in the Digital Earth Africa GeoMADs are the:\n",

    "-   Euclidean Median Absolute Deviation (EMAD)\n",
    "-   Bray-Curtis Median Absolute Deviation (BCMAD)\n",

    "Geomedians have been a popular input dataset for machine learning classification workflows. For example, Digital Earth Africa's [cropland extent map](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Cropland_extent_specs.html) is derived from the Sentinel-2 semiannual Geomedians [[1](#ref-burton2022)]. The Digital Earth Africa geomedians have also been used for crop type mapping, irrigated area mapping, and monitoring vegetation dynamics [[10](#ref-liu2024); [16](#ref-wellington2021); [14](#ref-weitkamp2023a); [15](#ref-weitkamp2023b); [13](#ref-wardle2022)].\n",

    "Supervised classification requires reference data to train and validate models. For crop type mapping, this generally means spatial information collected from agricultural surveys is used. Field surveys are resource intensive and any field collected data is valuable, though may need manipulation before it is used in classification and mapping workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several principles and guidelines that should be followed when collecting reference data for crop type mapping or assessing its value. The Group on Earth Observations, through the Joint Assessment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring, have published [guidelines for cropland and crop type definition and field data collection](https://jecam.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/JECAM_Guidelines_for_Field_Data_Collection_v1_0.pdf) [[6](#ref-defourny2014)]. The TetraTech Enabling Crop Analytics At Scale initiative have [published guidelines for the collection of reference crop type data using ODK software](https://cropanalytics.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ODK-Agriculture-User-Guide-v0.4-1.pdf). There are also numerous academic materials exploring various sampling techniques for crop type mapping field data collection [[7](#ref-fowler2020); [3](#ref-chenxi2022)].\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has presented a workflow which draws on open access data sources to produce a crop type and crop group map for an area of Rwanda. The workflow showcases how GeoMAD composite images can be a useful data source and produce reasonably accurate classifications, considering unbalanced training data and a challenging agricultural landscape characterised by heterogeneity and small fields. In this context, the workflow is representative of real-world crop type mapping challenges. However, this workflow should be considered as an introduction and starting point for development of more refined agricultural mapping. The accuracy of the classification could be improved by further refinement of training samples and the introduction of more predictor variables in the classification models. Furthermore, post-processing, such as spatial smoothing or object-based image analysis—may also enhance map quality by reducing noise and improving thematic coherence, including in the cropland extent map.\n",
